        Doro Wot Recipe

        Ingredients:


        1. 2-3 lbs. chicken pieces (drumsticks or thighs, skinned, fat removed)

        2. 5 large onions, finely chopped

        3. 3-4 garlic cloves, minced

        4. 1 tbsp fresh ginger, minced

        5. 3 tbsp berbere spice (adjust according to heat preference)

        6. 1/4 cup niter kibbeh (Ethiopian clarified butter) or regular clarified butter

        7. 1 cup chicken broth or water

        8. 4 hard-boiled eggs (peeled)

        9. Juice of 1 lemon

        10. Salt, to taste


        
        Instructions:


        1. Marinate the Chicken: In a large bowl, place the chicken pieces and sprinkle with salt and lemon juice. 
           Ensure the pieces are well-coated. Let them marinate for at least 30 minutes. 

        2. Rinse the Chicken: After marinating, rinse the chicken pieces well under cold water to remove any lemon juice and salt. 
           Pat dry with paper towels.

        3. Cook the Onions: In a large pot or dutch oven, melt the niter kibbeh over medium heat. Add the finely chopped onions and cook, 
           stirring occasionally, until they are soft and translucent (about 15-20 minutes).

        4. Add Ginger and Garlic: Stir in the minced ginger and garlic and continue to cook for another 3-4 minutes.

        5. Add Berbere: Reduce the heat to low, and then stir in the berbere spice, ensuring that the onion mixture is well coated.

        6. Add the Chicken: Place the rinsed chicken pieces into the pot, making sure to cover them with the onion and spice mixture.

        7. Add Liquid: Pour in the chicken broth or water, ensuring the chicken pieces are submerged. If needed, you can add a bit more water or broth.

        8. Simmer: Cover the pot and let it simmer on low heat for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the chicken is tender and cooked through.

        9. Add Eggs: About 10 minutes before the stew is ready, gently cut slits into the hard-boiled eggs and place them into the pot, ensuring 
           they're submerged and can absorb the flavors of the sauce.

        10. Serve: Once the chicken is cooked and the sauce has thickened to your liking, season with additional salt if needed. 
            Serve the Doro Wot hot, traditionally over injera.
